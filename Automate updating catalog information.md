- It generates PDF reports for supplier data.
- It uploads images to a web server.
- **It processes supplier images to change their resolution and format.**
- It sends error emails for system health checks.

## Question 2
What is the primary purpose of the Python Imaging Library (PIL)? 

- A library for handling database connections and queries in Python.
- **A library for working with and manipulating images in various formats.**
- A framework for machine learning and artificial intelligence.
- A tool for web development and creating dynamic web content.

## Question 3
In Python, what method is recommended to convert raw images with alpha transparency layers to RGB images without losing important information?

- **Use the "convert_alpha" method.**
- Execute the "flip" method.
- Apply the "rotate" method.
- Utilize the "resize" method.

## Question 4
In the lab, what does changeImage.py primarily aim to do? 

- Create a PDF report for the processed images.
- **Process and resize images to specific specifications.**
- Send images by email to the supplier.
- Check the health status of the system.

## Question 5
In the lab exercise, what is the correct sequence of steps to process supplier data and generate a PDF report?

- **Run run.py to process descriptions, create the PDF report, and then send it via email.**
- Run health_check.py to check system health, generate the PDF report, and send it via email.
- Run changeImage.py to process images, generate the PDF report, and then send it via email.
- Run report_email.py, create the PDF report, send it via email.

## Question 6
What is the primary purpose of the requests module? 

- To create graphical user interfaces (GUI) in Python applications.
- To manipulate and transform data stored in various file formats.
- **To send HTTP requests and handle HTTP responses.**
- To conduct numerical and scientific computing in Python.

## Question 7
What does the health_check.py script primarily monitor in the background?

- **It monitors system statistics.**
- It monitors network connectivity issues.
- It monitors software updates.
- It monitors file permissions.

## Question 8
In a real-world server monitoring scenario, how can the knowledge and skills gained from setting up the health_check.py script be applied to ensure server reliability and stability? Select two applicable scenarios. Select all that apply.

- Tracking Employee Attendance: Use the script to monitor the attendance of employees logging into the server and generate daily reports.
- **Managing Printer Queues: Employ the script to monitor printer queue status and automatically resolve printing issues.**
- **Monitoring CPU Usage: Continuously check CPU usage and receive alerts if it exceeds a defined threshold, allowing for proactive performance management.**
- Analyzing Weather Data: Apply the script to analyze weather data and generate weather reports for a weather forecasting application.

## Question 9
Imagine you are responsible for maintaining a server in a critical environment. You want to ensure that the server's health is monitored continuously, and you receive immediate alerts if there are any issues. Which Python script from the lab content would you use, and how would it help you achieve this goal?

- **health_check.py - This is designed for server health monitoring and immediate alerts.**
- reports.py - It generates PDF reports for supplier data, but it doesn't monitor server health.
- emails.py - It defines email generation and sending methods, not for server health monitoring.
- report_email.py - It processes supplier fruit description data and sends reports through email, not designed for server health monitoring.

## Question 10
What are the key steps involved in the process of updating your company's online website with new products in the lab's scenario?

- Processing images and descriptions, creating a webmail inbox, and running stress tests.
- Generating a PDF report, monitoring system health, and sending emails.
- Setting up a cron job, installing the stress tool, and sending emails with health status.
- **Creating Python scripts for image and description processing, updating the website, and generating a PDF report.**
